# My dotfiles

(the Pam edition, forked from [mdb](https://github.com/mdb))

My Mac OS shell, vim, tmux config, dotfiles, etc.

Largely stolen from and/or inspired by [lolindrath](https://github.com/lolindrath), [justincampbell](https://github.com/justincampbell), [matschaffer](https://github.com/matschaffer), [fatih](https://github.com/fatih/dotfiles), and plenty of colleagues over the years.

## Installation

The `dotfiles` assume you're using Mac OS, [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh), and homebrew.

```
git clone CLONE_URL ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
./install.sh
```
